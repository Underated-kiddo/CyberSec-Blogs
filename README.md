## 🔒 Cybersecurity Challenge Write-Ups

This blog contains detailed walkthroughs of the cybersecurity challenges I solve as I continue learning and sharpening my cyber security skills.

Each write-up focuses on **how the challenge works**, **the exploitation technique used**, and **the step-by-step process** I followed to reach the flag.
I’ll be posting challenges from platforms like **247CTF, PicoCTF, HackTheBox, TryHackMe**, and others — covering topics such as buffer overflows, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, web vulns, privilege escalation, forensics, and more.

### 📘 What to Expect

* A clear summary of the challenge
* Tools used and why
* Full explanation of the exploit technique (e.g., Ret2Win, format strings, ROP, etc.)
* Commands, payloads, and code snippets
* Screenshots when necessary
* Final thoughts and lessons learned

### 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

Writing these blogs helps reinforce my learning, organize my methodology, and build a reference I (and others) can return to later.
It’s not just a flag hunt — it’s about understanding the vulnerability, breaking things down, and explaining them clearly.

### 🚀 New Posts

As I complete more challenges, I’ll keep dropping fresh, organized write-ups right here in the blog — each one fully documented so anyone can follow along.
